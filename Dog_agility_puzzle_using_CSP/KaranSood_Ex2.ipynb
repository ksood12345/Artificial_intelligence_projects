    "### DOG AGILITY COMPETITION USING PYTHON CSP\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we try to solve dog agility competition puzzle as a constraint satisfaction problem using Python CSP. We define a set of constraints on the basis of clues given to solve the puzzle and then use those constraints to arrive at a solution. </br>\n",
    "The solution helps us to identify the name of the dog along with their breed, their favorite sport and the rank that they achieved in the agility competition."
